# DNS-Filtering

Conclusion 

This hands-on project guide provided a foundational understanding of creating and managing outbound rules in Windows Defender Firewall to enhance network security. By focusing on DNS traffic control, you developed essential skills to manage network traffic effectively and protect systems from potential security threats. 

Key Outcomes: 

Locating Windows Defender Firewall Settings: 

Navigated through the Control Panel to access the advanced settings of Windows Defender Firewall. 

Understood the structure and purpose of outbound rules in network security. 

Creating Outbound Rules to Block DNS Traffic: 

Configured an outbound rule to block DNS requests by targeting UDP traffic on port 53. 

Applied the rule across all network profiles (Domain, Private, and Public) to ensure comprehensive coverage. 

Assigned meaningful names and descriptions to the rules for easy identification and management. 

Verifying Rule Effectiveness: 

Successfully tested the rule by attempting to access websites, confirming that DNS requests were blocked. 

Gained insights into troubleshooting and verifying rule behavior using Windows Defender Firewall. 

Practice Exercises for Advanced Scenarios: 

Exercise 1: Explored how to block DNS traffic to specific IP addresses (e.g., Google's public DNS server 8.8.8.8). 

Exercise 2: Learned to allow DNS traffic only to specific servers (e.g., Cloudflare's DNS server 1.1.1.1) while blocking all others, demonstrating a fine-grained approach to traffic control. 

Key Takeaways: 

Granular Traffic Management: Windows Defender Firewall enables precise control over DNS traffic, allowing administrators to permit or restrict access to specific servers. 

Enhanced Security Posture: Blocking unauthorized DNS requests mitigates the risk of DNS-based attacks and unauthorized network traffic. 

Importance of Cleanup: After testing, removing or disabling temporary rules ensures no unintended impact on network functionality. 

By mastering these configurations, users can apply DNS filtering techniques to safeguard network integrity and enforce organizational security policies.
